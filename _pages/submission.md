## Formatting & submission guidelines
Participants are encouraged to submit their research in the form of a poster, video presentation, or other digital formats (any format that can be shared via the conference website). All submissions should be publicly available, either through hosting on the byteMAL website or hosted externally. 

Posters can be prepared in either a vertical or horizontal orientation. However, we encourage you to be creative and submit something with animation, interactive elements, or other features that would not be possible with a traditional static poster! For example, you could use an animated or interactive plot, HTML dashboard layout, or short video (e.g. record a mini slideshow). 

Similar to traditional posters, other submission types should be usable and understandable by anyone reading and/or using it without the help of the author. For example, by a brief tutorial, explanatory text, or instructional video. If you want to share a link to a larger project, you must also submit a short written or visual summary!

## Submission procedure
All posters and other submission types for the byteMAL sharing session that are able to be hosted by the byteMAL website should be submitted to byteMALevents@gmail.com by **October 7th**. In the case that the submission cannot be hosted on the byteMAL website, a URL to the submission should be submitted by the same deadline.
