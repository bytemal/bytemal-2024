## byteMAL sharing sessions {#sharing}

Share your work during our "sharing sessions." (*It's like a poster session but better!*)

Registered participants can submit an abstract for an animated or interactive poster, short video or other media. 
If your abstract is accepted, your submission will be hosted on our website and briefly presented during one of the small-group parallel sharing sessions. 
Submitting a traditional poster format as a pdf is also possible!


## Virtual flashtalks {#flashtalks}

A few of the best abstracts will also be selected for a 7-minute flashtalk presentation, which can be instead of, or in addition to, your digital media submission.
