    <p><strong>byteMAL</strong> is a conference created by and for early-career researchers in the fields of bioinformatics and systems biomedicine, 
    and aims to provide a networking platform for knowledge and expertise exchange across borders. 
    All are welcome to <a href="/bytemal-2020/register">attend</a> and <a href="/bytemal-2020/submit">present</a> at
    byteMAL, but especially PhD candidates, post-docs and students (master’s and bachelor’s).</p>
    <p>We aim to vitalize communication amongst researchers from the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. 
    byteMAL has been hosted alternately by the Universities of Maastricht, Aachen and
    Liege over the last 4 years and for this <a href="/bytemal-2020/program">5th anniversary event</a>, 
    the organisation of byteMAL returns to Maastricht, but moves online! We intend to make the best use of this virtual format and build on byteMAL’s record of success.</p>
    <p>As researchers in related fields in neighboring regions we are excited to widen our perspectives by creating the opportunity to discuss methods, 
    tools, challenges and successes with people of similar mindset. 
    Participants will have the opportunity to be inspired by our interesting <a href="/bytemal-2020/program">keynote speakers</a>, 
    <a href="/bytemal-2020/submit">present their own work</a>, and <a href="/bytemal-2020/register">discuss</a> ideas, tools and approaches with each other.</p>
