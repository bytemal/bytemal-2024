## Abstract submission

**Share your work!**

During the conference, there will be a byteMAL *sharing session*, where participants get the chance to present their research and show their current ideas, results or products by means of a poster or any other type of digital format. In order to share your work at the conference, please submit an abstract using the template below. 

In addition, authors who submit an abstract will have a chance to present their work in a flash talk session during the conference. The submitted abstracts will be evaluated and nominated for a **7 minute** flash talk by the organizing committee.
