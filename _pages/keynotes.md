        <h6>BIO</h6>
        <p>Ruud JG van Sloun (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees (cum laude) in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree (cum laude) from the Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, in 2012, 2014, and 2018, respectively. Since then, he has been an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology and since January 2020 a Kickstart-AI fellow at Philips Research, Eindhoven. From 2019-2020 he was also a Visiting Professor with the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. He is an NWO Rubicon laurate, received a Google Faculty Research Award in 2020, and was included in Elsevier’s 30 under 30 most influential young people in the Netherlands. His current research interests include A.I. and deep learning for (ultrasound) signal processing, model-based deep learning, compressed sensing, inverse problems, ultrasound imaging, and probabilistic signal and image analysis.</p>
        <h6>ABSTRACT</h6>
        <p>His talk will elaborate on deep learning strategies in ultrasound systems, from the front-end to advanced applications, thereby discussing the possible impact of deep learning methodologies on many aspects of ultrasound imaging.  In particular, it will outline methods that lie at the interface of signal acquisition and machine learning, exploiting both data structure (e.g. sparsity in some domain) and data dimensionality (big data) already at the raw sensor level. Several illustrative examples will be given, covering efficient and effective deep learning solutions for adaptive beamforming (focusing) and a framework for structured signal recovery by learning fast data-driven solvers of typical inverse problems in ultrasound imaging. 
Finally, Ruud will also discuss his recent work on COVID-19 in collaboration with the university of Trento (Italy), in which AI-enhanced ultrasound is used to establish whether a patients is suffering from severe lung disease.</p>

        <h6>ABSTRACT</h6>
        <p>Our scientific culture is driven by the need for constantly producing headlines and getting recognized by scoring high in measures like impact factors for journals and H factors for individuals. However, this has led to very inefficient usage of resources by not encouraging sharing and the reuse of data from others. Additionally, there are areas where individuals or even individual groups are not able to provide all evidence to come to conclusive results. One of these areas is toxicology and the related topics of risk assessment and especially nanosafety. The paradigm shift from an animal-experiment-based to a mechanistically-driven science based on in vitro and in silico studies made it necessary to combine data from many different experiments to describe hazard, risk and, for nanomaterials extremely important, physicochemical characterization into integrated approaches to testing and assessment (IATA). Large EU funded consortia developing such approaches clearly demonstrated that early, well documented data sharing is the only possible way to cover this complexity and validate the approaches to achieve regulatory acceptance.</p>
        <p>Many sophisticated systems for data management exits developed by companies, infrastructure or individual research projects and initiatives like NanoCommons, ELIXIR and now the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) are bringing these together into larger and larger data platforms spanning multiple communities. However, this is only one part of the story. Researchers generating the data are still reluctant to share their data fearing to lose their competitive advantage. Additionally, collecting a sufficient amount of metadata to describe the data to be understandable by others is a time consuming task and is often postponed until the last minute. In this talk, I will present how a designated data shepherd can support the data providers and data curators to prepare the datasets for upload, discuss with database managers and management/sharing tool developers on how to best support the generation, annotation and upload, and generate a clear legal and ethics framework to remove sentiments on losing control and intellectual properties. In a forthcoming paper [1] the data shepherd is defined as <em>“an enhanced version of a data steward, who not only oversees the data management, handling and quality control processes, but can communicate in a clear and simple language with all parties and resolve any misunderstandings”</em>.</p>

        <h6>ABSTRACT</h6>
        <p>High‐throughput sequencing methods have provided a means to quantify the structure, diversity, and function of microbial communities with accuracy, and our understanding of the roles of host‐microbe associations for host fitness and function has advanced considerably. Nonetheless, few studies have provided an integrative inter-kingdom (i.e. beyond bacterial communities) perspective of host-microbe interactions and their role in driving ecosystem functions. In this webinar, I will discuss how my research program develops a mechanistic understanding of microbial communities by using a combination of observational studies and manipulative experiments  to link foliar plant-microbe interactions to plant ecosystem functions.</p>
